This program uses Riot API to calculate the amount of time you have played League of Legends since the start of season 10 (Jan 10, 2020). It also gives a per gamemode breakdown and displays who you play with most often. Only supports summoners on the North American server. To use,

1. Obtain a Riot API key [(see here)](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal#web-apis_api-keys), and paste it in line 10 of `stats.py` as a string.
2. Run `app.py` (e.g. with `py app.py` or `python app.py`) and follow the instructions on screen.
